  "body": "The RNA Science Toolbox provides a Python API (PyRNA) to do RNA science. PyRNA allows you to:\r\n\r\n* parse RNA data from \"classical\" file formats (PDB, CT, FASTA, VIENNA,...) and convert them into easy-to-use and easy-to-analyse data structures:\r\n    * [Pandas Series and DataFrames](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html)\r\n    * \"PyRNA objects\" (as defined in the module pyrna.features).\r\n* compute RNA data from RNA algorithms (see below for details) and convert them into Pandas data structures and PyRNA objects,\r\n* recover RNA data from public databases ([PDB](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do), [RFAM](http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk),...) and convert them into Pandas data structures and PyRNA objects,\r\n* deploy some functionalities as REST Web services.\r\n\r\nThis project is related to the [DockeRNA project](https://github.com/fjossinet/DockeRNA) which provides Docker images containing the RNA algorithms you may need.\r\n\r\nYou can [follow this project on twitter](https://twitter.com/RnaSciToolbox) to get updates as they happen.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nTo use the RNA Science Toolbox, you will need to go through several steps. But don't be afraid, each step is really easy to follow. We do suppose that you are using either MacOSX or Linux.\r\n\r\n### Python environment\r\n\r\nYou need at first to have a Python distribution installed on your computer. If you don't have one, we recommend you a distribution like [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda).\r\n\r\n### Fabric\r\n\r\nYou also need the tool [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org). If you're using the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda), you can get it by typing:\r\n\r\n    conda install fabric\r\n\r\n### Python dependencies\r\n\r\nOnce done, download the RNA Science Toolbox and go into its directory. To install its Python dependencies, you can  use either the package manager conda (from the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda)) or pip. To use conda, type:\r\n\r\n    fab\r\n\r\nTo use pip, type:\r\n\r\n    fab install:manager=pip\r\n\r\n### Docker\r\n\r\nTo install the RNA algorithms, you need first to get the tool Docker. You will find all the details [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).\r\n\r\n### RNA algorithms\r\n\r\nEach Docker image available contains several algorithms:\r\n\r\n * [fjossinet/assemble2](https://hub.docker.com/r/fjossinet/assemble2/): provides [RNAVIEW](http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu/ndbmodule/services/download/rnaview.html), [Vienna RNA package](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/), [foldalign](http://rth.dk/resources/foldalign/), [LocARNA](http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/LocARNA/)\r\n * [fjossinet/rnaseq](https://hub.docker.com/r/fjossinet/rnaseq/): provides [SAMtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net), [Tophat2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/), [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)\r\n\r\nGo to their Web page for more details about their installation and usage.\r\n\r\n### Configure your PATH\r\n\r\nIn the configuration file of your shell (.bashrc, .zshrc,...), add the folowing lines:\r\n\r\n    export TOOLBOX=THE_PATH_TO_YOUR_RNA_SCIENCE_TOOLBOX\r\n    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$TOOLBOX\r\n    export PATH=$PATH:$TOOLBOX/files/scripts/python:$PATH\r\n\r\nRestart your shell and type:\r\n\r\n    pyrna_tests.py\r\n\r\nYour RNA Science Toolbox is fully configured if you get something like:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nRecovering entry 1EHZ from Protein Databank...\r\n\r\n## 3D annotation ##\r\n\r\nList of base-pairs computed with RNAVIEW:\r\n\r\nedge1 edge2 orientation  pos1  pos2\r\n0      (     )           c     1    72\r\n1      (     )           c     2    71\r\n2      (     )           c     3    70\r\n[...]\r\n</pre>\r\n",
